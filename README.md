# Angular 12 Template

Use this as a template for Angular 12 projects with the following, opinionated base setup ready to go:
* ESLint
* Prettier
* Jest
* rx-signals
* Typescript with safety belt, like:
  * strictNullChecks
  * strictPropertyInitialization
* OnPush change detection as default schematic

After `npm install` you can use:
* `ng serve`
* `ng build`
* `ng test` to run Jest
* `ng lint` to run ESLint
* `npm run format` to run Prettier on all source files
